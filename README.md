# Catalonia: The land of touristic apartments

## Introduction

Our goal for this project was to analyze the rise of tourism in Catalonia using Airbnb (or other tourist rental) data. We achieved that goal, though weren’t able to come to the kind of firm conclusions we were hoping to find through our data analysis. Our original intention was to correlate the rise of rent prices with the proliferation of tourist rentals, but our statistical analysis actually showed that though there was a correlation in some places, it wasn’t strong and couldn’t be tied to an increase in rental homes. 

Instead, we decided to focus on the defining characteristic we discovered: that there are really two Catalonias. One is full of tourists — in some places there are more tourist apartments than regular ones — and the other is all locals. 

Our story focuses mainly on the 87.4% of municipalities that have Airbnb listings and the patterns we could find, especially by organizing the municipalities into the nine tourist brands that the Catalan government uses: 

* **Barcelona**,
* **Costa Daurada**,
* **Costa Brava**,
* **Costa Barcelona**,
* **Val d’Aran**,
* **Pirineus**,
* **Terres de Lleida**,
* **Paisatges de Barcelona**,
* **Terres de l’Ebre**,

The final piece tells the story of these two Catalonias, and how tourism impacts them each individually.



## In this repository
... In the [`app`](app) folder you'll find a boilerplate(ish) template, it's similar to the `mvtec-svelte-app`, with the addition of `svelte-materialify` —so we don't spend too much time overdesigning the UI.

You also have a [`data`](data) folder. Think of it as the playground for your data.
