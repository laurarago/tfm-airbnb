## Introduction

... Example we have to change...

Last year, COVID-19 locked us home and upended our lives.

They were hard times for many, and we want to explore the relationship between **our struggles** and **our solidarity** during the pandemic using [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/).

The idea for this project is to visualize the dichotomy: 
* **Who/When/Where/What for we ask for help**,
* **Who/When/Where/What for we offer help**.

A look at the trend in the last 5 years shows [a peak around March last year](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=help) ... was it the pandemic? 

For example mental health issues, international solidarity and ways to support Black Lives Matter pop up in this view of [last year's trending topics](https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/US/#4816dfbf-7056-428a-a89d-03bbd4a29ba6)

We're thrilled to count with the support of [Google News Lab](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/google-news-lab): [Simon Rogers](https://simonrogers.net/) and [Alberto Cairo](http://albertocairo.com/) will assit with the data, editorial and visual angle of this project!! They'll also be joining us at the hackathon on May 15.

## In this repository
... In the [`app`](app) folder you'll find a boilerplate(ish) template, it's similar to the `mvtec-svelte-app`, with the addition of `svelte-materialify` —so we don't spend too much time overdesigning the UI.

You also have a [`data`](data) folder. Think of it as the playground for your data.
